# TypeScript Practice

This project defines a `Person` type, creates a list of people, and prints out information about them using template literals.  

## Run

First compile the code:
```bash
tsc index.ts
node index.js
```

# Example OutPut:
"KING is 20 years old, and is student: true
JOE is 21 years old, and is student: false"
